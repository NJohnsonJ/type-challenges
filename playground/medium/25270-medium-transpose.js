  by Apollo Wayne (@Shinerising) #medium #array #math

  ### Question

  The transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often denoted by A<sup>T</sup>.

  ```ts
  type Matrix = Transpose <[[1]]>; // expected to be [[1]]
  type Matrix1 = Transpose <[[1, 2], [3, 4]]>; // expected to be [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
  type Matrix2 = Transpose <[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]>; // expected to be [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
  ```
