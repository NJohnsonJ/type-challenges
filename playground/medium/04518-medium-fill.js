  4518 - Fill

  ### Question

  `Fill`, a common JavaScript function, now let us implement it with types.
  `Fill<T, N, Start?, End?>`, as you can see,`Fill` accepts four types of parameters, of which `T` and `N` are required parameters, and `Start` and `End` are optional parameters.
  The requirements for these parameters are: `T` must be a `tuple`, `N` can be any type of value, `Start` and `End` must be integers greater than or equal to 0.

  ```ts
  type exp = Fill<[1, 2, 3], 0> // expected to be [0, 0, 0]
  ```
  In order to simulate the real function, the test may contain some boundary conditions, I hope you can enjoy it :)
