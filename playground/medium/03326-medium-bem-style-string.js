  ### Question

  The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (BEM) is a popular naming convention for classes in CSS.

  For example, the block component would be represented as `btn`, element that depends upon the block would be represented as `btn__price`, modifier that changes the style of the block would be represented as `btn--big` or `btn__price--warning`.

  Implement `BEM<B, E, M>` which generate string union from these three parameters. Where `B` is a string literal, `E` and `M` are string arrays (can be empty).
