  ### Question

  Given an array of unique elements, return all possible subsequences.

  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

  For example:

  ```typescript
  type A = Subsequence<[1, 2]> // [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2]
  ```
