  191 - Append Argument
  -------
  by Maciej Sikora (@maciejsikora) #medium #arguments

  ### Question

  For given function type `Fn`, and any type `A` (any in this context means we don't restrict the type, and I don't have in mind any type 😉) create a generic type which will take `Fn` as the first argument, `A` as the second, and will produce function type `G` which will be the same as `Fn` but with appended argument `A` as a last one.

  For example,

  ```typescript
  type Fn = (a: number, b: string) => number

  type Result = AppendArgument<Fn, boolean>
  // expected be (a: number, b: string, x: boolean) => number
  ```
